# Source code of [duncanm.dev](https://duncanm.dev)

This repo contains the source code of my personal website, running on [Laravel](https://laravel.com). 

The site's not done yet. In fact, it'll probably never be done. Although, when it's actually live I'll create a write-up of building this site.

## Roadmap

* [ ] S3 Media uploads
* [ ] Change when post is published
* [ ] add errors to crud update screens
* [ ] Fix image proxy issues for S3 through Github Markdown
* [ ] Fix script parsing issues
* [ ] Move pages to using database markdown
* [ ] Newsletter signup form
* [ ] Webmentions
