            <p>I'm a web developer and a full-time college student from Glasgow üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø, even if it's just for three days a week.</p>
            <p>Since a young age, I've always liked playing around with computers. From recreating Windows in PowerPoint to messing around with regedit.exe (bad idea, don't do that).</p>
            <p>I don't know why I like the web and why I've kept working on it but it seems to be very interesting.</p>
            <p>I'm the creator of ReadCast, a Saas app that converts articles to audio and adds them to your own little personal podcast. When I have time, I'll try to pick up some <a href="https://littlepenguin.dev">freelance work</a>.</p>
